Enhanced Trigger Box is a free tool that be used within Unity. It allows developers to setup various responses to be executed when a player walks into a certain area. You can also setup conditions that must be met before the responses get executed such as camera conditions where for example the player musn't be looking at a specific object. Or player pref conditions such as progress through a level. Responses are executed after all conditions have been met. These range from spawning or destroying objects to playing animations or alterings materials.
